<p> I will discuss PowerShell commands and their uses in this mini-project. Powershell is a Microsoft tool that allows you to automate tasks on your computer through commands. Powershell is a stronger version of the command prompt as you have more control over your commands, such as managing files, setting up networks, and controlling settings. Starting Powershell can be a bit confusing at first, but with practice and these useful commands, you will learn quickly.</p>
